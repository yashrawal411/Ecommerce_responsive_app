# Ecommerce_responsive_app
Responsive web app using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The purpose of this application is to develop responsive web app with the help of HTML,CSS and Javascript which can render properly on different screen  sizes such as 
Mobile, Tablet, Computer & large screen computers.
While developing this UI , I understood the concepts of CSS properties such as Flexbox, Box model, use of Id & classes, media queries, etc.
I have also used Javascript concepts to make site dynamic. 

Please find snippets of application below :
